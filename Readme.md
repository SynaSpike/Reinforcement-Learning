# Frozen Lake Q-Learning
## Project Description
This project implements a reinforcement learning algorithm called Q-learning to solve the Frozen Lake problem in the OpenAI Gym environment. The Frozen Lake problem is a simple gridworld problem where the agent needs to navigate through a grid of frozen and slippery tiles to reach a goal tile. The agent receives a reward of 1 when it reaches the goal tile and a reward of 0 for all other actions. The goal of the agent is to learn the optimal policy that leads to the goal tile with the maximum reward.

## Installation
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

``` git clone https://github.com/SynaSpike/Reinforcement-Learning.git ```

2. Install the required packages

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

## Usage

```python FrozenLake_QLearning.py``` 

This will generates the Q_table and display the Agents finding its path on the Frozen Lake environment.
